Hi!

Thank you for visiting my site! It really means a lot me that you are taking time time out of your busy day to check out what is going on in my life :)

# WHO AM I?
===
My Name is Juan Avalos and I was born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. If you are not familiar with Mexico geography, it is the state that looks like a schnauzer dog on the map, as you can see below.

# WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF MY WEBSITE?
===
I decided to create my own website to have a place where I can share some of my creative projects with the world, express my feelings about what is going on in my life, and document the adventures my wife and I embark on throughout our marriage.
