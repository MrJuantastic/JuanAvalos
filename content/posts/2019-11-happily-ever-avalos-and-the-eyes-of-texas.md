Without further ado, I present to you **Happily Ever Avalos and the Eyes of Texas!**

- - -

*I can barely hear the voices. I stand waiting outside the door, nervously biting my nails. What can possibly be happening? The room falls silent. The door opens. Fish emerges clutching her phone.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: What is going on? Are you okay? You just ran into the room and waived me off.

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: Yeah, I just needed to go somewhere quieter.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: And?

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: It’s happening!

*For the first time in a long time, I am actually speechless. Could this be true? Could this finally be happening?! It takes me a second to recollect myself.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Is it really?! I knew it! I told you!

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: I’m so happy! I have been so stressed out these last couple of days. My armpits are sweating!

*She raises her arms to show me her armpits and laughs.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Are we really doing this? What do you think?

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: Hell yeah we are doing this!

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I’m so freaking proud of you.

*I reach over and hold Fish in my arms. She looks up at me and gives me the warmest smile I’ve ever seen.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: We’re going home.

*She holds me both tightly and tenderly at the same time.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: We’re going home.

*We hold each other for a while, soaking in the moment.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: Okay after all that I’m actually hungry now. Can we make food?

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Absolutely 😊

THE EYEEEEEES OF TEXAS ARE UPOOOOOOON MEANDFISHBECAUSEWEAREMOVINGBACK TOTEXAAAAAAAAAS!!!!

Fish’s road to getting her Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing has been one of the most grueling I have ever seen. However, after countless study group sessions, quizzes, and lab packets that we can count, ya girl finally graduated! Look at how flipping cute and happy she was during her graduation! Isn’t she just ADORABLE?!?!

> *Literally Fish being the most amazing and adorable human being to ever exist. And look, no sweaty armpits! YAS QUEEN!*

Believe it or not, this was not the highlight of her day. Now you may be asking, Juan what could possibly be a better highlight than graduating and being done with daily homework assignments, weekly quizzes, and bi-weekly tests for 16 straight months? I will tell you audience. Accepting a job offer for your dream job (and then some since she is also getting cross-trained in 2 additional units) in Austin, Texas (the best city in the best state in THE United States) literally an hour before you graduate! I know, it’s wild. It is safe to say that between accepting her offer, graduating, and getting fine wined and dined all in one day, Fish was feeling on top of the world.

After three years, but really it felt more like a decade, we are finally saying goodbye to the Midwest and its terrible winters and saying hello again to Texas and its warm weather. Fish accepting her offer officially kick-started our long-awaited exit from Ohio. This means that the following things all now have to happen within the next two months before Fish starts her nursing residency on July 8th:

Did I forget to mention that we also wanted to see Niagara Falls and attend a wedding in Boston the last week of June? I honestly do not know how we are going to have energy to do all of these things and not neglect our mental, physical, and emotional states. Like I mentioned in Happily Ever Avalos Vol 2, available exclusively at fivetoninemag.org which if you have not checked out you should do right after you finish reading this, Fish and I have been slowly moving towards this life-changing set of events. We did not think it would play out quite like this as I thought I would actually be going to grad school in California, Austin, or New York, but more on that on Happily Ever Avalos Volume 4. Regardless of how we got here, we are both committed to this much needed change of scenery and embrace the adventure that lies ahead of us.

Over the last couple of weeks, I thought long and hard about what I wanted the focus to be for this volume. I knew for sure that I wanted to take a moment and celebrate Fish and her accomplishments. Check. I knew I also wanted to talk about how we are moving back to Texas. Check. Besides those two things, I kept drawing blanks. I thought about writing on how Fish and I plan to support each other over the next couple of weeks, but that would be double-dipping a bit from Volume 2. I thought about writing about tips and tricks to help others moved cross country. I personally have moved a ton in my lifetime as I am now nearing 35 total moves, with 3 of them being in Ohio alone. Even though I liked the idea, I did not believe this format would be the best to convey those learnings and decided to do that as a separate project for a later time. As time went on and I still could not find a way to tie this all back together, I grew more and more discouraged about writing this volume at all. However, given by the fact that you are now reading this, I figured it out.

Over the last three years I have been basically shiting on the Midwest. I constantly complain about the horrible winters, the lack of diversity, the non-authentic ethnic food, and most importantly how the eastern time zone is absolute TRASH. Let me be very clear when I say that the Midwest is not going to be something I will miss. However, I will miss the genuine people I have met and am honored to call friends.  I will miss the hidden mouth-watering, super rare restaurants that made it possible to get our foodie fixes. The one single most beautiful and breath-taking magical moment that I will reminisce about until my very last breath. I will forever hold all this near and dear to my heart. That is the focus of this volume.

Without further ado, below is my top 4 list of things I have found and will miss as we make our move back to Texas:

4. My XLR8 Family

XLR8 is the P&G new hire program that accepted me with open arms as I first came to Cincinnati way back in the summer of 2014. This group consists of fellow young professionals who are also trying to adjust either to life as an adult or a new place like Cincinnati. Through this group I have done things I never thought I would do or were too intimidated/nervous to attempt in a new city. We created beautiful pottery. We mentored high school students about STEM careers and college. We went Go-Karting. We made crepes. We volunteered at a woman’s shelter. Through these and so many more activities, I made and nurtured bonds with some truly amazing people. In particular, there have been five people (Carlos Baez Alvarado, Janae’ Newman, Yasmin Kamkar, Katie Coleman, Brian Raderstorf) who have truly continued to push me to become a better leader and made my time, as a member and as the co-leader of XLR8, truly unforgettable. Thank you all for allowing me to serve all of you and for giving me a safe place to be myself. 

3. Jungle Jims, Dewey’s Pizza, Mazunte, Cloud 9 Sushi, Pho Lang Tang, and The Eagle

Y’all, I cannot stress enough how deprived Fish and I were of our favorite foods in Ohio. Pluckers, Taco Joint, Franklin’s BBQ, P. Terrys, any taqueria/taco truck, Elote en Vaso, Tortas, and so many other places that we left back in Texas. During our time in Cincinnati, and Ohio as a whole, these were the only places that did not disappoint when it came to food. The list goes from what slapped to what really SLAPPED slapped. Jungle Jim’s, which is an award winning supermarket and not a restaurant, allowed us to shop for authentic spices, antojitos, and ingredients from all over the world. Dewey’s Pizza (shout out to their Porky Fig Pizza) became my all-time favorite pizza place of all time. Mazunte held it DOWN in the Latin food section. Their memelitas are what inspired the best breakfast dish that I cook, the Don Juan. Cloud 9 sushi had half-priced sushi basically all the time. Need I say more? Pho Lang Tang was a double threat as it nailed both in the food and drink department. Their Pho and Bánh mìs are absolutely delicious and their Vietnamese coffee is my second favorite coffee of all time, behind the café de olla from my favorite birria place in San Luis Potosi. Last and certainly the best, The Eagle is singlehandedly the best restaurant in Cincinnati and you cannot change my mind. Their fried chicken? SLAPS. Their spicy honey? SLAPS. Their fries with chipotle aioli? SLAPS. Their brown sugar bacon? SLAPS! Their mac & cheese? F#%$ING SLAPS. If you ever find yourself in Cincinnati, make sure to hit up these spots, you will not be disappointed.

2. Our Friends

After college it was hard to imagine making such strong connections with other people. Little did we know that we would find a loving and supporting group of people that made us feel as though we were family. This is why it will hurt so much to say good-bye to all of them over the next couple of weeks. Whether through volleyball, board games, music festivals, puzzle crawls, or simply just a small get together and grill out, we never had a dull moment. The key core people (Bianca D’Silva, Tracy Krohn, John Russell, Sonam Patel, Brian Bachir, Berenice Reyes) and all the other caring and passionate people that we are humbled to call our friends, made it more tolerable for Fish and I to survive in Ohio these last three years. I literally cannot continue writing more about this topic since I am already tearing up thinking about saying goodbye and also because I know I am about to melt writing about the final and best thing Fish and I got from Ohio.

1. Alms Park

My favorite thing about Ohio is and will forever be Alms Park. This is the place where Fish and I said “I do” to each other and began our journey as a married couple. I honestly cannot explain the feeling this place gives me every time Fish and I go back to it for an afternoon walk or to watch a sunset. 

![Our Wedding Day <3](/uploads/juan_fish_wedding.jpg "Our Wedding Day <3")

> *The happiest day of our lives <3*

The way Fish looked as she walked out of the pavilion and down the aisle. The best man and maid of honor speeches given by Miguel, Frenchi, Enrique, and Ashley. Fish and I’s first dance under the moon light. The breaking of my infamous piñata, Pepito. Our family and friends dancing the night away. This park will hold these unforgettable and magical moments that I forever cherish.

There you have it. The end of a chapter filled with wonderful people, establishments, and moments that have forever changed our life. It is time for Fish and I to embark into a new chapter. One that inspires us to befriend fantastic people, explore new establishments, and create more enchanting moments. It might get rough at times and we may not find what we are looking for in Austin, pero mientras estemos juntos, todo estará bien.
