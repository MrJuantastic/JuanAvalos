Hi Everyone!

I am extremely excited to introduce y'all to a new series called Happily Ever Avalos! In this series I will be sharing with y'all the adventures my wife and I embark on as a married couple and the memories/hardships/lessons we have experience along the way. 

This series started when a friend of mine, Zelenny Lozano, founded five to nine magazine, a digital zine and website where regular people can share creative work and endeavors, as well as comment open and honestly about the realities of adulthood. Now what you see below is the original article I submitted and was featured in Five To Nine Vol 1. To read the more colorful and artistic version, and check out more cool work from other amazing creators, make sure to visit the [five to nine website](https://fivetoninemag.com/) and [subscribe to the mailing list](https://fivetoninemag.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4022678040daebd86db5f0506&id=8ac3133fe6) to receive full access to the five to nine e-zine in your inbox!

Without further ado, I present to you **Happily Ever Avalos and the Marriage Commandments!**

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúHow are you so bad at this?‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!‚Äù 

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúAre you even doing it like I told you?‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: ‚ÄúYes, I am doing it just like you told me!‚Äù

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing exactly what you told me! It just isn‚Äôt working!‚Äù

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúWell apparently not because we are still not getting through.‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: "You know what, I don‚Äôt want to do this anymore. I need a break.‚Äù

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúTry it one more time. You got this.‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: ‚ÄúFine, one more time.‚Äù

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúDo you want me to go through it with you one more time? I can do it first, so you can see how to do it‚Äù

<span style="color:darkblue">Wife</span>: ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: ‚ÄúRemember it‚Äôs all about timing. You have to jump on top of the penguin‚Äôs head and then hold the jump button as you land on him like this to jump higher and get the bananas.‚Äù

\[Wife then proceeds to do the movement flawlessly and geeks about the fact that she did it herself. We high five and we continue to enjoy Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze]

This is what a typical conversation looks like with my wife, Felicia (you can call her Fish), when it comes to video games. You see, she never really played them growing up, so she lacks the mechanics to get through certain games. We recently got a Nintendo Switch to help unwind and to spend some quality time together. Well, really it‚Äôs because Nintendo announced they were releasing some of my favorite games (Megaman, Crash Bandicoot, and Super Smash Bros Ultimate to name a few), but I DID want to find a new fun way to spend some time with Fish. 

Just like we argue about video games, we tend to argue about other silly little things. Some days it‚Äôs how she leaves her socks all over the living room, which she knows is my number one pet peeve of hers. Some days it‚Äôs how I come home from playing sand volleyball and forget to dust off outside. Some days it‚Äôs the dishes, other days it‚Äôs laundry. The list goes on and on. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we are in a loving and committed young marriage, but we do argue like an old married couple. However, we know the difference between a silly little argument that‚Äôs more of a joke and a serious disagreement that needs to be addressed. It all comes down to knowing each other so well and being able to read the other person.

Before I get into the swing of things, let me give a little background since this is the first time you‚Äôve heard of me. It will be a bit lengthy, but bear with me, I promise I will loop it back. Our story began when my parents decided to move our family from Mexico to good old McAllen, Texas in 2007, or when I was starting 7th grade. My mom is from Chicago and wanted my brother and I to get an education in the States, hence the move. Moving to a new city, for the 16th time in my 13 young years, to a new school in a new country was overwhelming for me, however, it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I was a good and smart kid, so I fit in with the school and the teachers nicely, but what surprised me the most was how fast I made friends. I mean, I had done this before and usually made one good friend by the end of my first week, but this time around I made FIVE whole friends in less than a day! It was pretty unbelievable for me. 

In case you haven‚Äôt put it together, one of those friends was Fish. We quickly became best friends and she helped make the rest of my transition a walk in the park. Long story short, we have known each other since we were 13. We went from best friends to dating in 10th grade, when she broke my heart into a million pieces and we became frenemies, but we‚Äôll cover this some other time. We then went back to being best friends in 12th grade, and then in the summer of 2012, before going to college, we rekindled our romance. We dated all summer and five years later we got married on September 16th, 2017. I know what you are thinking, we are stinking cute and we know it too üòä

_Fish and I with our beautiful doggo, Rocka, at our wedding reception_

We have been through a lot in our now 11-year adventure and we have had many ups and downs. We even came close to breaking up twice within our first 6 months of dating, but at the end of those tough two nights, we both agreed on the same thing: we were willing to fight for each other and tackle the issue together. So we laid out ground rules for our relationship and always kept the core of its values ahead of us. Communication. I cannot say it enough. I‚Äôll say it again so it sticks. COMMUNICATION, COMMUNICATION, COMMUNICATION! It has been key in our relationship and key to understanding how to swim together through this unpredictable journey called life. This is how I knew she wasn‚Äôt really upset that she couldn‚Äôt get the bananas from above the penguin. She was upset that I was not showing her HOW to do it, since she is a visual person and the first couple of times I just told her and expected her to do it like a natural, which she isn‚Äôt quite yet.

Without further ado, I want to share with you the top 4 ground rules that have helped Fish and I‚Äôs relationship and may help yours as well! Some of these may or may not be obvious, but I feel that even if you know them, a refresher is always useful üòä

## Get to know your partner‚Äôs love language!

Knowing each other‚Äôs love languages has helped us a ton in understanding each other. My primary love language is ‚ÄúActs of Service‚Äù and it honestly means the world to me when Fish goes out of her way to help me with tasks that I either do not have time to do myself or to make tasks more efficient. Now sometimes I go to overboard and ask Fish to help me with 5 things at the exact same time and I know it drives her nuts, so she calls me out on it nicely. I‚Äôm working on it honey, I promise! 

Likewise, Fish knows that my least dominant love language is ‚ÄúPhysical Touch‚Äù, which coincidentally, was Fish‚Äôs primary (or dominant) love language when we first started dating. I hate PDA and Fish loves it. But after we took the quiz, which you can take online for free, Fish and I were able to compromise on where, when, and what level of affection to show in public. This allowed us to both satisfy Fish‚Äôs PDA needs, and not make me feel so uncomfortable, which leads me to‚Ä¶

## Never ever force your partner to do something that is uncomfortable!

You figured this one would be common sense, but I have seen tons of my friend‚Äôs relationships crash and burn because they do not follow this rule. There is a difference between forcing your partner to do something they deem uncomfortable and gently pushing and encouraging your partner to step out of their comfort zone and overcome their fears themselves. One example that comes to mind is Fish and volleyball. She usually does not like playing volleyball and it makes her uncomfortable when others try to force her to play and make her feel bad for not playing. It took me a while to find out why she did not like it, basically a huge dude ran her over once when playing in high school. 

Instead of making her feel uncomfortable, I found a group of friends who liked to play volleyball and invited her to watch us play so she could see that they were coordinated enough not to run her over and respect her space. Every time we played I asked her to play with us, she would say no, and I would respect her answer. It took over a year and a half of slowly pushing and encouraging her, but one day she finally decided to play and she actually enjoyed it! One small victory for Fish! üòä

## Understand each partner‚Äôs stress triggers and how they handle stress

Earlier in our relationship I tended to shut down and push away people when I got mad or stressed. Fish is more of an anxious person and gets mini panic attacks when she gets stressed. It took a couple of fights for us to realize how we needed to react to each other to not make matters worse. Fish now understands that I need a couple of minutes to process what is bothering me, use that time to clearly articulate a calm response in my mind, and discuss how we can tackle the issue at its root. 

I also now understand that I need to validate Fish‚Äôs feelings and concerns. I need to reassure her that everything will be alright by creating a structured plan we can follow. When it all comes down to it at the end of the day, it is about being honest with your partner, clearly communicating with each other when there is an issue, and finding ways to move forward together. It‚Äôs not you versus your partner, it‚Äôs you and your partner versus the problem. 

## Strive for an equal partnership

This should be at the core of every relationship, plain and simple. If there is no equal effort from both parties, then problems are inevitable. This started out as a joke for me and Fish when we first starting dating. It all started how when I said that when I get married, I would want something of similar value to my future bride‚Äôs engagement ring. My go at the time was a watch, which if you know me, you know how much I fancy a good watch. We laughed about it at first, but ever since then we have used this as the foundation of our relationship. We try to maintain an equal partnership in all aspects. You can even ask our best friend Enrique and he will even tell you we say ‚Äúequal partnership‚Äù to each other to keep each other accountable. We both come half way for a kiss, both wash dishes evenly, and we split the drive to and from any location. When we got married I didn‚Äôt get the super fancy watch that I wanted, but Fish got me an incredible blingy wedding band I didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I love my wedding band and to me it‚Äôs worth 10 super fancy watches.

However, there have been times in our relationship where one of us must carry more responsibilities for a while. They key to avoid conflicts is both of us understanding and agreeing to the temporary shift. For example, Fish made the decision to go back to school and become a nurse. She got accepted to an accelerated program in which you get your bachelor‚Äôs degree in 16 months. Given the accelerated timeline, her schedule is overloaded with classes, clinical rotations, and never-ending assignments, quizzes and tests. I fully supported her decision and fully aligned to me increasing my responsibilities around the house while she is in the program to help her be successful in her program. I started cooking more of the meals, washing more of the dishes, doing more of the laundry all to allow Fish to focus on school.

To me, marriage can be compared to a video game very easily. The players must work together and put time and energy to get through puzzles, complete quests, and get through the most powerful and epic boss fights. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I need to go show Fish how to jump between vines and get the missing ‚ÄúG‚Äù piece so we can unlock the next Donkey Kong Temple Level.
