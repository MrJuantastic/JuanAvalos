Without further ado, I present to you **Happily Ever Avalos and the Quarter Life Crisis!**

****

I sleepily stumble into the bathroom. I turn on the lights and reach for my toothbrush. The moment I begin to brush my teeth, my phone begins to ring. I go back to the bedroom to see it‚Äôs Fish and I answer the call.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Hi babe. Did you forget something?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: ‚Ä¶

She doesn‚Äôt say anything, but I can hear her quietly sobbing. I no longer feel sleepy.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Fish? Are you okay?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: No.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: What‚Äôs wrong?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I‚Äôm having a panic attack.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Are you still driving? Pull over.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I am. I‚Äôm parked.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Okay take a deep breath and then tell me what happened?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I started driving to work and then I started thinking about how much I don‚Äôt want to be at work and how the thought of being at work was stressing me out and depressing me and I started freaking out and then I started hyperventilating and I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I pulled over and then I started crying and then I called you because I just want to quit and ‚Ä¶

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Hey, it‚Äôs okay. Breathe please. Breathe in and breathe out. Come home and we‚Äôll talk about it, okay? We can figure out what to do together. Take your time and once you feel like you are calm enough, you come home okay?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Okay.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: It‚Äôs going to be okay. I love you and get home safely. We‚Äôll figure it out together once you get home.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Okay, I love you. I‚Äôll be right home.



In our seven years of dating, Fish and I have had three deep conversations that led to life changing decisions. The first conversation was whether it made sense for us to start dating the summer before we went to two different colleges. We ended up deciding we did want to start dating and boy did that work out for the both of us. The second conversation was if we were serious about moving out of our home state after college. This conversation basically meant that we were serious enough to get married and start our own lives together. Lastly, the third conversation began with the phone call I just shared with y‚Äôall. The decision we made that morning after she got home has been the biggest life changing decision we‚Äôve made together and still impacting us to this present day.



When we moved to Ohio, Fish had landed a job teaching biology to high school sophomores. In actuality, Fish wanted to teach elementary kids, or the ‚Äúitty bitties‚Äù as she likes to call them. Nevertheless, she remained optimistic about teaching and molding the minds of the next generation of our country. The optimism did not last long as this phone call occurred exactly six months after she started teaching. What caused her to get this emotional breakdown? Well, it was a combination of things. She was teaching in one of the toughest school districts in her area. The teachers and the administration struggled to gain financial resources from the state to properly operate the school. She ended up spending her own extra time and money to provide for her classroom. Some of her students had troubles at home, which carried over to the classroom in many ways. These were some of the reasons to Fish quitting her job, but the main driving reason was the impact on her mental health.



Fish is one of the most unselfish and kindest people you will ever meet. She always does whatever is in her power to ensure she is helping others. When faced with the decision to quit, her biggest fear was being taken for a selfish person. When the system she was trying to have a positive impact on is fundamentally broken, it drove her depression and unhappiness levels through the roof. I had to convince her that it is okay to be selfish when it comes to your mental health. If you cannot take care of yourself, it is extremely hard to help others. After we talked it out, together we concluded that the best decision for her was to quit her job and take some time to figure out what career path that she would find joy in and allow her to maintain her mental health.



As a couple, we both agreed to the temporary path we were about to embark. Fish would look at other career opportunities while taking a less demanding full-time job at a daycare to help with our finances. We would also have to move to a cheaper apartment and spend less a month in food and entertainment to meet our new budget. Now at this point, I was also starting to consider if my job was the right one for me. However, we both agreed that for the time being, we were committed to focus first on Fish‚Äôs needs and take as long as needed until she found the right career she wanted to pursue. It was a life changing decision that we knew would be best to do sooner rather than later.



Fast forward to one year later and Fish was now happily married, to the most handsome and amazing man ever üòä, and enrolled in a 16 month accelerated program to get her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree at Xavier University. If only you could have seen how she was after she came home from her first day of classes. It is truly one of the happiest I‚Äôve ever seen her in the 12 years I‚Äôve known Fish. She was all excited and giddy about all the nice people she met and the content she was learning. In that moment I knew we made the right decision for her to take a year off, continue to discover herself, and taking steps to follow her passions. As I type this, Fish is two months away from finishing nursing school and she is ACING IT! She has even made the dean‚Äôs list every semester y‚Äôall! We have the letters up on our fridge and everything! I know she is going to be a great nurse once she graduates üòä



_I mean look at how DAMN CUTE Fish looks in her nursing clothes. LOOK AT HER!_



I understand that doing what Fish and I are doing is not as easy for every young (married) couple. Everyone‚Äôs circumstances are different. Not everyone has someone to support them through such a drastic career change. Not everyone can survive their job for two more years, like I did for Fish, to allow your partner the freedom to re-discover themselves. Not everyone knows what they want to do with their lives. If you do need to have a deep conversation to make a life changing decision, I recommend talking with your partner about the six questions below. Getting to understand your each other is critical to make sure you make the best-informed decision that you can.



## 6.  Are you happy with where you are right now?

It is EXTREMELY CRITICAL that you answer this honestly. It is okay to be vulnerable and wear your heart on your sleeve. If you are not honest, you will most likely fail in getting back on track and repeat the whole cycle. Accepting there is a problem is the first step towards making a positive change.



## 5. If we must make a change, what is the key driver for the change that we are making? 

Define it. Is it that you are unhappy because you are too far away from your family? Is it because you are not in the career you thought you wanted to be in? Is it that you simply know you are worth more than what you are currently getting paid and want to make more money? Understanding your motives can help to filter down the list of possible scenarios that have been running through your mind.



## 4. What is your passion and how can you pursue it? 

Cliched, but simple and effective. Make a list of things that inspire and motivate you and try to find career paths merge with your passions. If you are having a hard time thinking figuring where your passions truly lie, then get out there and try new things! Take cooking classes. Take acting classes. Join a book club. Go to tech conferences. Allow yourself to be open to new experiences and you may find out a whole new side of you that you didn‚Äôt know existed.



## 3. Is this a temporary change or a permanent change? 

Identify whether there are simple steps you can take to get back on track, or if you need a couple of weeks, months, or even a year to figure out where you want to be. There is no shame in doing either of these options, as long as you do it at your own pace and on your own terms.



## 2. What would we be sacrificing to make this change? 

Both of you need to know what you are signing up for prior to making a big decision. There will be sacrifices. There will be disagreements on what are each other‚Äôs priorities. It is critical that these sacrifices are outlined and both of you each other accountable in accepting them for as long as they are needed. 



## 1. How can we help each other throughout this change? 

At the end of the day, it must be a partnership. That is the main principle that cannot be broken for all of this to work. Communicating to your partner throughout this process is something you have to do with each other to be able to move forward. You don‚Äôt like how something is shaping up? Communicate it. You feel stressed and need help? Communicate it. You found something that found you joy? COMMUNICATE IT DAMN IT! Constantly support and build each other up.



As much as we are excited about Fish finishing up school, we are also now preparing to have our fourth life changing conversation: what‚Äôs next? As I mentioned before, I have been thinking if my job is the right one for me. The simple answer is that it‚Äôs not. It is now Fish‚Äôs turn to support me and my turn to figure out what I want to do. We have already gone through these questions and are laying down the ground work to make our final decision in about two months. This decision is going to be so critical that it might mean moving across the country to chase both mine and Fish‚Äôs passions. Regardless of the outcome, we will courageously charge into this next chapter of our lives together. To me, that‚Äôs all that matters.
