Without further ado, I present to you **Secret Weapon.**

****

Fear brings me nightmares that keep me up at night,

Fear welcomes the darkness that takes over the light.

Fear floods in the feelings that Iâ€™ll never be enough,

Fear makes me believe that I am not worthy of love.

Fear tries to bring me down and block me from my destiny,

Fear is strong but there is something stronger deep inside of me.

Love encourages me to never give up the fight,

Love stands beside me and reassures me everything will be alright.

Love wraps around me and makes my worries disappear,

Love gives me the strength to overpower my fear.

Love is the secret weapon to defeat all tyranny,

Love is the answer to a life filled with prosperity.
