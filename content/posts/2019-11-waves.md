Without further ado, I present to you **Waves**

- - -

I

Was not

Aware that I

followed the wrong path

Of studying science and math

Needed a new direction

Change of perception

Reflection

I

Hit low

Began to regrow

Build enough self esteem

Courage to follow my dreams

Begin a new endeavor

Joy and laughter

Happily ever

After

Some time

Before my prime

I felt very discouraged

But I knew even though

I had no clue

Wrong or right

Begin to

Write

My thoughts

On paper for

Days until the words

Began coming like angry waves

I finally became ablaze

And gained traction

New satisfaction

Everyday

Constant worry

About chasing glory

But as Lin Manuel

Miranda said you have no

Control who lives who

Dies who tells

Your story

However

I have

In my control

What my story contains

The choices I make ensuring

Not dying in vain

You will see

My own

Legacy
