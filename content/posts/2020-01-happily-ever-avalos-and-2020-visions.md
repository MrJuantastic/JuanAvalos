*Fish and I are sitting at the dining room table. Rain falls heavily outside. The energy inside the room is tense. Fish is on the verge of crying.* 

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I honestly did not believe it was going to be this hard.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: We talked about this. It is not like it came out of nowhere.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: No, we didn’t. I don’t remember that.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Yes, we did. We talked about it together before moving back. We both agreed that this is something I would try to purposely pursue for the next three to five years.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: It still doesn’t change the fact that we are struggling.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Well now that I am done with grad school applications, I can start looking for a job to help us until we know what the next year will look like.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Even if you get a job now, it will take a full month for us to see that money.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I know, but we can’t control that. We can make it until then without a problem if we manage our expenses. We just have to try and not make stupid purchases.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: You’re making feel guilty about buying sodas at work when I’ve had a shitty shift. 

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I want to tell you yes to the things you want because you do deserve them, but I have to tell you no because we can’t afford them. We both know that talking about money gives you anxiety and I have to be the one that tracks our finances and makes sure we don’t go under.

*Fish covers hers face with her hands.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Well it still feels like I can never relax. When will I have something to look forward to?

*Fish begins to cry. My heart breaks to see her like this. I hold her hand. Rocka tries to lick her face to make her feel better.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Look, I know it’s hard, but we’ll figure it out. Together. We just need to budget better and focus on the things we can control. That will help things get better. We also have the income tax to help us out.

*Fish looks up and wipes her tears. She thanks Rocka and Rocka goes to lie down on the bed. Fish looks at me.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I just can’t control this and it stresses me out. I need to work on not getting anxious over situations I cannot control. 

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: You are already doing everything you can. We both know how hard your job is and I am not asking you to do more than that. Your job ensures we have food on the table and a roof over our heads.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: It just feels like I am not doing enough and it’s just hard.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: All of this is hard for me too. For the most part I am the one that keeps the house clean and running. I’m the one that does most of the cooking to make sure you have food for your shifts and when you wake up after your shifts. I am the one that keeps track of our finances and stresses about making sure all the bills get paid. I deal with addressing all my family drama because God knows no one else will do. I support your family too and help with your family drama. I had to do all that while still working to finish my grad school applications.

*We look at each other as the rain gets louder outside.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I just feel -

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I know, I know we have to budget better.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: That wasn’t even it.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Then what is it?

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I FEEL FUCKING SAD.

*Fish gets caught off guard by what I said. I begin to cry. Her face immediately softens.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I feel like I have been in a depression over the last three months. Our finances are fucked, my sleep schedule is super off, and my mental health is at an all-time low. My grandmother literally just passed away and with everything going on I feel like I haven’t been able to grieve. You get anxious and emotional when you are stressed out because that’s who you are (Fish chuckles at this remark) and I feel that even with all of this going on, I have to be the one to keep us positive and moving forward because otherwise we will both collapse. You said it earlier that misery loves company. I know for a fact that if I don’t keep it together, we will collapse.

*I wipe the tears from my eyes but continue crying.  Fish hold my hand.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Come on. Go to the bed.

*I lie down next to Rocka on the bed and I cuddle with her. Fish comes and spoons me.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: You’ve told me to be more selfish so I am being selfish and I want cuddles… I just really want you to get in babe. Everything would be much better if we knew what you are going to be doing for the next two years. You are so talented and I want nothing but to see you succeed and be happy doing the things you love. I feel like I was frustrated at you, when I should be frustrated at the problem. Like you always say it’s me and you versus the problem, not each other. The extra shifts should help us out and the income tax will be a nice boost. I don’t know if this is helping, but it’s helping me. We also need to start going to the gym. And drinking more water. And I want to spend more time with you because I feel like I don’t get enough time with you since we only see each other for two hours on the days I work and I sleep for most of the day when I don’t. As long as we are together we will figure things out. I love you.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I love you too.

*The rain outside slowly stops. I stop crying and close my eyes. She rubs my back and plays with my hair as we remain cuddling in bed.*

When we left Ohio to come back to Texas we were so excited. We knew we were making a big change and taking some big risks, but at the moment we were more caught up with the process of coming home that all the worries were put in the back seat. Well now it is seven months later, and we are finally feeling the magnitude of our huge life-changing move. I won’t sugar coat or look for silver linings. The last seven months have been incredibly challenging not only for us personally but for our marriage. 

Fish and I never claim to be perfect. However, often we get comments from friends and family that Fish and I have a perfect marriage. People tell us that we are very supportive of each other, always seem to be on the same page, and that we are a “goals” as a couple. Just like everyone else, Fish and I know we have problems or dilemmas that we need to work through and address together. The only difference is that when we strongly disagree we stop ourselves from discussing any problem we may have in public. We strongly believe that we should handle our problems in private and in a civilized matter. Throughout our time together, Fish and I have actually not had that many fights; I would say 99/100 fights we have are in a silly way or not big enough to be a problem and we let it go. However, once every couple of months, or sometimes years, we have that one fight that actually matters, and emotions tend to escalate. The dialogue you just read is from the one fight Fish and I  had shortly after the new year started and where things got a bit more tense.

We are choosing to show this with everyone to give an insight to our marriage and how even when we tend to have a very emotional fight, we try to remain as loving and as respectful as possible. We try not to raise our voice or cuss, huge emphasis on try. We absolutely never resort to name-calling. We never attack each other’s character. Above all else, we recognize that if we are not in a loving mood then we know not to even begin discussing any issue at hand. We wait until we are both in the correct mindset to have a conversation and be able to have constructive discourse. Over the last seven months, it has taken a lot more conscious effort from both Fish and I to stick to these ground rules and clearly communicate and work on our marriage. Our overall motto is something I say all the time. It is me and you vs. the problem. It is never you vs. me vs. the problem. Every single day we try our best to live this motto. Some days we do great and we celebrate each other for our efforts. Some days we fail but we give each other grace and support to get back on track. 

It took me about a solid month to decide what I wanted to write for this installment of Happily Ever Avalos. It has been seven months since I wrote the last installment of this series and a looooooot has happened in our lives. I decided that I will break down the good and bad things that have happened since our move back to Austin thus far. I am hoping that by doing this I can achieve three things.

1. Serve as my personal venting space.

   a. More often than not, when you write things down you can take control of those things vs. them taking control of you.
2. Share the lessons Fish and I have learned

   a.	Life is always about learning and sharing what you have learned with others
3. Be able to start the new year fresh and share with you the new and exciting goals and visions Fish and I have set for ourselves and each other. 

Now I cannot also fit every single little thing that has happened in here. Therefore, I will break it down into the top 5 good and bad things that have happened in the last seven months. So, let’s start with the bad things.

## 5. Fish’s start date at her new nursing job got push back by a month and her first paycheck for 2 months.

Alright, this one was basically the very first thing to go bad when we moved back to Austin. Essentially what happened was that the accelerated program Fish graduated from was not in the system for the Texas Board of Nursing. This caused Fish’s application for her license to be deemed incomplete. The Texas Board of Nursing saw this error and went “we are going to wait for her to reach out to us about this problem. The problem was that THERE WAS NO NOTIFICATION, NO EMAIL, NO NOTHING TO LET US KNOW THERE WAS AN ISSUE! How the fuck were we supposed to reach out to them about it?!?! Anyway…luckily their office is here in Austin and we went to tell them about the situation and if it wasn’t for us guilt tripping them into doing it, they wouldn’t have gotten their shit together to get Fish her license. This issue pushed back Fish’s start date by a month and her first paycheck by two months. That meant we had to live of our savings 2 extra months without any income, something we did not account in our planning.

* #### Morals of the story

     Don’t be afraid to reach out to your job/internship/board/whatever if you have not heard anything. If phones/emails are not working, and if you can, visit the office and hold them responsible if they messed up. o	If you are planning a trip/move like we did, budget some extra money and then add half of that amount if you can and you will be set for any unforeseen circumstances.

## 4. Family Draaaaaamaaaaaa

As much as we have enjoyed having our family around, something I will discuss in the good things section, it also has brought in a loooot of family drama. It doesn’t help that all this drama has added extra stress to some of the things Fish and I have tried to focus now that we are back in Austin. I won’t spend much time here, because every family has it and I’m sure you understand. It is just something Fish and I kind of did not get a lot of living halfway across the country.

* #### Moral of the story

     It is okay to hold your family responsible for their actions. It is also okay to take a break from your family to recharge and focus on yourself. 

## 3. Grad School Applications

Let me explain. Yes, part of the reason for us moving back to Austin was for me to pursue a different career path and that currently implies graduate school. However, the process of applying to graduate school has been nothing but stress inducing. First thing was studying to re-take the GRE. I cannot stress enough how much I detest standardized testing. I mean, I studied hundreds of words for the verbal section and I LITERALLY ONLY SAW TWO OF THEM IN THE WHOLE TEST! I’m not upset or salty about it at all…okay maybe just a tiny bit. In addition to retaking the test, there were also a lot of time-consuming requirements for the applications. Making sure that everything is at the best quality possible while dealing with all the distractions and setbacks life throws at you is extremely challenging. Not to add that it is still rather expensive to apply to graduate school. Couple it all together to ensure everything gets submitted and processed in time for the deadline and you got yourself an exhausting overall not great time.

* #### Moral of the story

     If you are planning to apply to graduate school, give yourself at least a solid year prior to the deadline to work on the applications.

## 2. Fish’s Night Shift Schedule

Uff. This one was going to be my overall number one bad thing if the number one bad thing had not happened recently. When we first moved down we thought night shift was not going to be that bad. Let’s just say we were super wrong. Night shifts have been tough on Fish because she works 12- 14 hours straight over night, which means that when she gets home somewhere between eight or nine in the morning, she then proceeds to sleep in until somewhere between three of 5 o’clock in the afternoons and then go back to work around 6:15 pm to do it all over again. You can see how this can be incredibly exhausting both mentally, physically, and emotionally. Night shifts have been tough for me because as a natural night owl, I have slowly and steadily been staying up later and later to sort of awkwardly match her schedule. This has meant a lot late nights with me writing/gaming/reading/binge watching in a dark room. The night shifts have brough a level of isolation to both Fish and I that we did not expect. Not only has night shifts messed with our sleeping schedules, but it has also messed up our workout regimes, our eating habits, our family time, and most importantly, our Fish and Juan family time.

* #### Moral of the story

     Night shifts are hard so it’s extra critically that you try to take time for yourself. Meditate. Drink Water. Get good sleep. Eat balanced meals. Stay active. Be kind to yourself.

## 1. My grandmother passing away

I will never forget where I was when I found out. It was Dec. 28th and we were about to open presents with my niece when I got the call. Nothing in this world would have prepared me for the news. She started feeling sick at dinner on the 25th. She got blood work on the 26th. We found out she had sickle cell anemia on the 27th and her body was beginning to shut down. The doctors decided to do a hail mary and do a blood transfusion. The blood transfusion was tricky because at that point the sickle cell anemia would mean that her body could reject the blood and it would be her body attacking her body. It didn’t work. She passed away on the 28th. They had a viewing memorial the same night. The mass was the next morning and they cremated her that afternoon. Everything happened so quickly. The worst part was that unfortunately Fish and I could honestly not afford to travel back to San Luis Potosi. I was absolutely heartbroken. This is the first major loss I’ve experienced in my life. I am still grieving. I believe I will be grieving for a while still. My grandmother was the absolute most sweet, kind, and loving human being I have ever met. I loved her so much. I miss her so much.

* #### Moral of the story

     Call your grandparents. Call your parents. Call all of your loved ones. Tell them you love them any chance you can. Try to see them if you can. You’ll never know when it will be the last time you see them.

I try not to dwell on the bad things if I can. I usually do try to keep things positive. But as someone who used to bottle up his emotions, I am learning to allow myself to be more in touch with my emotions. These bad things have been just the tip of the iceberg. A lot more has happened, but luckily, there has been more good things than bad things. Before I get to them, let’s cleanse the pallet, shall we? Here is Rocka being an absolute derp.

Alright, now we are in a better place. Let’s get to the good things.

## 5. NO MORE WINTER!!!!

Most normal people might not think this is a good thing, and let me tell you, they are wrong. After 3 real winters in Ohio, having Texas weather has been incredible. No snow. No black ice. Not having to defrost your car and remove ice from your mirrors. No need to wear five layers to try to stay warm. In my opinion, the move was worth it just for warmer weather. 

* #### Moral of the story

     Live somewhere warm.

## 4. Getting to eat all the Austin food

Pluckers. Taco Joint. Ramen Tatsu-ya, Julie’s Noodles. Franklin’s Barbecue (we even got to meet Aaron Franklin when we went!). Trudy’s and their Mexican Martinis. Chi’Lantro. Estancia Churrascaria. Velvet Taco. The list goes on and on and on. 

![Meeting Aaron Franklin](uploads/franklins.png "Meeting Aaron Franklin")

> My brother, cousins, Fish and I meeting Aaron Franklin, the owner and pit master of Franklin’s BBQ! 

Fish and I love to eat and we are so happy that we can have these restaurant so close to us again. Not only that, but we have so many of our favorite Mexican dishes and cuisines, like barbacoa and cecina, readily available whenever we want. We can literally drive 10 minutes in any direction and find a taco truck or a Michoacana Meat Market to supply us with all our cravings. Since we’ve been back we have had more carne asadas by the pool than I can count. Which is amazing because we literally only used the pool and did carne asada like three times in Cincinnati. 

* #### Moral of the story

     Austin has great food to satisfy any craving you have. 

## 3. Seeing Childish Gambino at ACL

Gambino is my favorite performer of all time. He is an incredible artist, writer, actor, director, and creative genius. The last ten years have been an incredibly dominant period for him. We camped for his concert for nine hours and it was totally fucking worth it. Easily my favorite concert of all time.

* #### Moral of the story

     Gambino Forever

## 2. Being close to family and reconnecting with friends

Getting closer to our family was one of the primary drivers for Fish and I to move back to Austin. In the three years we lived in Ohio I was able to see my family three times and Fish got to see her family twice. Now we basically see our family all the time. We currently live in an apartment with Fish’s sister and get to see our niece over the weekends every two weeks. My brother lives 10 minutes away from us and we’ve helped him transition to his new house. Our parents are only a five-hour drive away and we see them quite often. We’ve gotten the opportunity to spend more quality time with them and learn from each other in ways we have never done before. We basically have immersed ourselves in our families once again, which also tends to cause some family drama. However, even if our families might bring drama and complications at times, they still serve as our main support system. At this moment in time, where we are working to figure out what we want our lives to look like for the years to come, we would not want to have it any other way.  

Another reason Fish and I were excited to come back to Austin was to have the opportunity to reconnect to our old college friends. However, not all of my friendships were in the best condition due to some wrongdoings I have done in the past that were never addressed. Over the past three years, I have embarked in a deeper self-reflect journey which has allowed my emotional intelligence and maturity to grow. I knew for me to truly regain the trust and love of some of my friends, I needed to address the past and how I was wrong and how I hurt them. I mean with one of my friends, who I know is reading this, we had a three-hour coffee talk in which we cleared up the air. There was no judging, no animosity, and no dishonesty. It was purely cathartic. Once I was able to be open and honest to these friends, we were able patch things up and begin to nurture our friendship once again. We’ve also had the opportunity to become friends with some very cool people since we’ve gotten back to Austin. We’ve had cookouts, birthday dinners, game nights, gaming sessions, tailgates and so many more activities that have helped with the transition and counteract the effects of night shifts. Because of our friends, Fish and I have slowly but surely began to feel more at home.

* #### Moral of the story

     If you can, and if you like your family, try to stay close to them. Your family, whether your own or the one you have chosen for yourself, is the most important thing in this world. In addition, friends are the family you chose. Pick them well and make sure to nurture those bonds as much as you can.

## 1. Freedom to nurture hobbies

This has singlehandedly been the best thing that has happened to me since moving back to Austin. Over the last seven months I have been able to play in two soccer leagues, play tennis, learn how to play softball, pick up my piano lessons again, complete a new painting, read a couple of books, cook a little more, gone mountain biking, write a whole new feature screenplay, write a new short story, create a website from scratch with the help of a friend, learn how to shoot and edit a video all by myself, play video games at my own leisure, work out and re-visit my bullet journal. These last seven months have without a doubt been the most creative and self-nurturing months I have ever had in my entire life. Sometimes it felt like I was not doing much, but now that I think about all the things I just wrote all down, I am so fucking proud of myself. When I decided to quit my job to pursue my creative talents, this is exactly how I hoped the majority of my time would be spent.

![Hollow Knight Painting](uploads/hollow.knight.painting.png "Hollow Knight Painting")

> My Hollow Knight Painting!

 I also do not plan to slow down as we move into the new year. My first goal is to post a picture a day on Instagram to get more comfortable sharing my life and my adventures with the outside world. Throughout 2020, I am pushing myself to complete and publish one new creative project per week, with this being the first one to kick things off. Once a month I will be releasing a new Volume in the Happily Ever Avalos series, a poem, a piece of art, and an article covering a topic of my choosing. My stretch goal is also to shoot, edit, and release a video every two months beginning in March. This one will require a little more effort and planning, but I am hopeful I can do it. I am well aware I am taking a huge risk leaving my very comfortable engineering job to pursue my creative projects. It is time to be brave and make moves to makes some or all of these hobbies into a career path. However, I certainly would not be able to do any do this without the love, support, patience, and guidance from my beautiful wife. She has been incredibly understanding with where I am in life and has been extraordinarily loving in supporting in getting to where I want in life.

* #### Moral of the story

     Follow your dreams and stay true to yourself no matter what you do. Your creations are your own and should be for yourself and no one else first and foremost. However, create what you want, when you want it, however you want it, and for whoever you want. Don’t let anyone dim your light and support those who are trying to shine their own.

- - -

If you have made it this far into me rambling, I want you to know that you are a real one. If any of the things I create and/or share resonate with you, I hope that they can help you with whatever self-doubt, family drama, life dilemma, or anything else that you may have going on in your life.  

Now if you excuse me, I am starving and want to make a dope ass lunch for me and Fish before she goes into work. I’m really feeling some chilaquiles with some coffee right about now.
