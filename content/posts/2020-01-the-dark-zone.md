It can hit you at any moment.\
It arrives without a warning,\
immediately souring your enjoyment\
as a dark storm angrily begins forming.\
Before you know it you fell all alone.\
You begin to fall deeper and deeper into the dark zone.

You try to scream for help but the words won't come out.\
The voices inside your head tell you that you're worthless.\
You can't help but succumb to them and fuel the self-doubt,\
wondering if it would have been better if your mother was birthless.\
You hide under the covers overwhelmed by the unknown.\
You fall deeper and deeper into the dark zone.

You desperately try to look for a sign to calm your fears.\
Any little thing to get you of this slippery slope.\
Right when you are about to accept defeat, a little ball of sunshine appears\
as your pet cuddles right next to you to give you warmth and hope.\
They remind you that you are not on your own\
and help you navigate out of the dark zone.

Your pet looks at you with their eyes full of wonder,\
staying by your side and cheering you on as your #1 fan.\
Their love for you is infinite and only grows stronger,\
thanking their lucky stars that you are their hooman.\
The storm slowly fades as you have found your way back home,\
leaving behind the lonely dark zone.
