Two and a half years. That is how long it has been since I‚Äôve had my last haircut. My wife and I were visiting our best friend for Labor Day weekend. At this point, I was starting to grow out my hair, but by wife and I agreed that I would cut my hair for our wedding, which was about a week out, and I wouldn‚Äôt have that awkward hair length for our wedding pictures. Fast forward two and a half years later, and my hair is as long, luscious, and beautiful as it has ever been. It‚Äôs taking me a little bit longer than I anticipated, but I am finally ready to donate my hair.

This is my third attempt at donating my hair. The first time I decided to grow out my hair was back in 2013 during the spring semester of my freshman year at UT Austin. Back then I wanted to donate money towards cancer research, but I was your typical broke college student so I decided that another way I could help was to grow and donate my hair. However, after about six months I came across a conflict. I got my first interview for a summer internship. My whole life I have been told that it is unprofessional to have long hair as a man. Society constantly tells us that we must always present ourselves in our best way and that meant having a short and clean haircut. Torn with this dilemma, I unfortunately decided to cut my hair for the interview. When I went in for my interview, I was asked about a difficult decision I recently had to make. I probably should have given a more professional/engineering related answer, but I brought up my hair. I mentioned how I struggled to make a decision because I wanted to stay true to myself and I wanted to make a positive impact in someone‚Äôs life with my donation. It just felt like I was giving up on something I believed in. My interviewer related to my answer and reassured me that my hair wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem at all. She mentioned that any company that rejects you for your hair style, especially if you are doing something for a good cause, shouldn‚Äôt be a company you should consider working for. This answer really resonated with me. After that interview I vowed to grow out my hair once again and never to be rejected for my morals and for who I am.

My second attempt at growing out my hair was the first time I actually donated my hair. It was a very unique and educating 18 months of my life. First and foremost, I want to say to all my ladies out there that y‚Äôall are the real MVPs. Having long hair taught me just how difficult and non-cooperative long hair can be. It can be a pain to work out with. It takes sooooo long for it to dry. You can spend so much time trying to make it look cute and sometimes your hair is just like ‚ÄúNah fam I‚Äôm good.‚Äù Braids are SOOOO hard! How do you do them?! Your arms get tired and you can‚Äôt see what you are doing! You shed like crazy and find your hair everywhere. Not all of it was bad though. It was an instant conversation starter. It also gave me a huge confidence boost since I constantly got comments on how healthy and beautiful my hair looked. My wife constantly tells me how jealous she was of my hair. The best part though, was when you have that just perfect ‚Äúgood hair day‚Äù and it just falls and curls in all the right places. I fucking love that shit. Through it all, I really enjoyed having long hair. Except for when I was interning in one of the most conservative places I have ever been. Like no joke, they had constant KKK rallies at this place. In this environment, I was already constantly being discriminated against since I was one of five Hispanics at work. Add having long hair to that and a lot of individuals also went out of their way to make homophobic remarks towards me. I refused to let this affect my work and my character. I utilized this experience to educate these people about cultural awareness as well as LQBTQ+ rights. Some people understood how they were wrong while others quite honestly did not give a shit. Let‚Äôs just say that after three months, I was very happy to get the hell out of there. Once I arrived back to Austin, I was ready to donate my hair. I have spent the last 18 months wondering how amazing I would feel when the day came. It might come a bit selfish, but it honestly did not live up to my expectations. It was actually pretty anti-climactic. It was me, my wife, and our best friend getting my haircut at our local mall hair salon. I got the hair, sent it out, and that was pretty much it. Life went on. Nothing more and nothing else. I felt extremely guilty for feeling this way. After some reflection, I came to the realization that it was because I still felt like I could have been doing more to this cause. Donating my hair simply was not enough.

I am now reaching the finish line on my third attempt. This time around, I wanted to get even more comfortable with my hair and create a bigger impact on those around me. First, I made it my mission to learn how to braid my hair. It is not the best, but I learned how to do simple braids and fishtail braids! Once I did this, I began wearing my braids in public and I got some more confidence boosting comments. Second, I wore my hair down a looooot more than I did the previous time. It felt like the only acceptable way to wear my hair before was the manbun and I wanted to better style and show my hair in all its glory. I truly love my long hair and I wanted others to see that as well. Third, I learned how to manage it better while I was exercising and just overall better ways to manage my hair on a day to day basis. Ladies, I am fully aware that this is your everyday life. I said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, y‚Äôall are fucking phenomenal and the real MVPs. This time around I got a lot more positive feedback about my hair. However, I also got a lot of negativity. Both in my professional and personal life I constantly got asked when I was going to cut my hair because I can tell they didn‚Äôt think I should have it long or how it wouldn‚Äôt be good in my career. I also cannot tell you how many comments and jokes I got about how I look like a girl or I was gay. It was overwhelming sometimes how many negative comments I would constantly from both total strangers, family, coworkers, and friends. Instead of getting flustered, I utilized these last two and a half years to continue educating people on cultural standards, LGBTQ+ awareness, and how it is okay to express your personality through hair. I have worked towards eliminating the negative stigma that having long hair is bad for men and how my hair does not make me any less professional. I have continued to raise awareness on the importance of cancer research and ways in which one can help. This time around, I feel like I have done a better job at owning this narrative. However, I was still dreading the day I had to cut my hair, knowing how I felt the after the first time I donated my hair. That‚Äôs when I came up with the best idea I‚Äôve had in a while.

As I mentioned before, I have grown very attached to my hair these last two and half years. Throughout this time, I‚Äôve faced a lot of ups and downs and my hair was one of the true constants that have remained in my life. I would be lying if a part of me wishes I could not donate it and keep it for myself. It has truly become an extension of myself (pun intended) and I‚Äôve learned so many valuable life lessons through it. However, I know that there is someone out there that will greatly benefit from my donation. Therefore, to help me deal with my sadness, I have decided to end this journey with a celebration. I‚Äôm talking full blown pool party and carne asada with a bunch of my friends and family. But that‚Äôs not the big part. The big part is to get people to donate money and vote on which haircut they want me to get after I donate my hair. It could be a simple style or a full crazy haircut with dyed hair. With the help of my wife and some friends, we came up with a couple of options that are sure to be crowd favorites. The haircut that gets the most donations will be the one I‚Äôll rock for a while. The best part is that people won‚Äôt know what haircut wins until I get to the carne asada and reveal the new look. This way I feel like I really celebrate the journey while raising funds and further awareness to the cause. That is why I created this GoFundMe and why I am reaching out to all of you. Help me celebrate the end of this journey by[ clicking this link](https://www.gofundme.com/f/juan-donates-his-hair?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1) and donating for one of the haircuts below to reach our donation goal total!

If at the moment you cannot donate but still want to help, you can still vote on a haircut, but I simply ask for you to share this campaign on your social media to help us get to our goal! I am excited for this event and to rock some short hair once again for a while. I know for a fact it will be 1000% times simpler to exercise, shower, and get ready in the morning. But part of me will always miss my beautiful and luscious long hair. Who knows, maybe in a couple of months/years I will begin growing out my hair once again üòâ

 I want to end this by thanking everyone who has ever shown me support and love throughout this journey. It is truly y‚Äôall who help make this process extremely more meaningful. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for standing with me in support of this cause.
