So a little back story. 

During the Spring of 2017 I was pondering what I wanted to get Fish for her birthday present. I had already convince myself I wanted to make her something, but I was not quite sure what specifically I could make her that would blow her away. Do I build her some cool DIY project for her to use around the house or do I use one of my artistic talents to create something for her? After a couple of weeks, I decided to rely on the craft I do best, which is drawing, since I knew there were less chances for me to fuck it up. 

At the time I was reading the Harry Potter books all the way through for the first time. I stopped reading halfway through the fourth book back in middle school and then I never got around to actually finishing them. So now that I was reading them, Fish and I were going through a bit of a Harry Potter phase as I read the books and we watched the movies so I could compare them. 

If you know Fish, then you know very well, or can easily identify, that she is a proud Hufflepuff. Like, she literally is the textbook definition of a Hufflepuff. She is extremely kind, caring, patient, honest, nurturing, loyal, and above all she loooovoes food. As I was reading the books, I could see myself having Ravenclaw and Griffindor traits. However, at the end of the day, I knew I identified more as a Ravenclaw, and the official Pottemore sorting quiz confirmed this as well. Soooooo as we were watching "*Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*", Fish's favorite movie, it suddenly just clicked. I should paint her a Hufflepuff house crest. I knew she would really fucking love it. Then another thought came into my mind. She also loves to paint. So what if I just drew her the Hufflepuff Crest, then drew myself a Ravenclaw Crest, and we could paint them together?! I know, I am such a romantic genius lol

Unfortunately, after a couple of phone switches, a broken phone, and losing some data when transferring data, I was not able to find any pictures showing the process of completing the Hufflepuff Crest. I know, quite sad. However, I did manage to hunt down a couple of pictures showing the process of completing the Ravenclaw painting, so there's that. I also want to point out that Fish finish her paining in basically one day and it took me like a full week to finish mine. She is is just waaay better than I am at blending and painting than I am lol However, once they were completed, we were both very happy and proud with our paintings! To this day, they still hang over us according to what side of the bed we sleep on.



If you would like to have your very own house crest, I am open and available to make and sell you a painting! Just reach out to me if that is something you would be interested in! :)
