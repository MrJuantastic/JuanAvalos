Anywaaaaay... A couple of weeks back I reallllly wanted to do something cool and fun with Fish since we had not had a date in a while. At the moment Fish was starting to get into watercolor paintings and we went out and got her some supplies so she could paint some cool stuff. I decided to put two and two together and told Fish I wanted to do a watercolor painting tutorial with her since I have ever utilized watercolors before. 

Fish finally had a couple of days off from work and we decided to sit down and do the tutorial together. Fish suggested we do a tutorial from **[Makoccino's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEYTvzdLrD1bx1NTOO4nwpA)** since she had some pretty easy tutorials for some really cool art pieces. We set everything up and I was really feeling really confident about jumping into watercolors. I mean, how hard could it actually be? Apparently the answer is very much lol We started following the steps and almost immediately my painting was not looking nearly as good as Fish's or Makoccino's. Determined to not lose hope, I reminded myself that this was just for fun and to spent some quality time with Fish. So, for the next hour and a half FIsh and I proceeded to paint away while laughing at our hilariously bad attempts to recreate the tutorial. When it was all said and done, our pieces did not come out as half bad as we had believe they did! We were both really happy and proud of what we have created. 

At the end of the day, it honestly did not mater how good or bad our paintings came out. Lately we have been getting a bit overwhelmed with everything that is going on in our life that we have not been able to spend that true quality time with each other. This was all about making an effort to spend time with each other, enjoy each others company, and have an enjoyable time just being silly together. With that said, here are Fish's and my paintings! I hope you enjoy them nearly as much as we enjoyed making them! :)
