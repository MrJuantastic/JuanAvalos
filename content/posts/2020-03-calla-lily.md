Hi Everyone! 

This previous weekend Fish was supposed to be in Dallas for a mini-vacation to celebrate her best-friend's birthday. As you can predict right now, the corona virus cancelled that plan and the rest of the plans we had for the next two months since we are self-isolating ourselves. These last two weeks have been incredibly stressful for everyone, but to Fish, being a nurse, they have been extremely challenging on her physical and emotional health. So to help lift her spirits and do something that would bring her joy, she shipped a care package to her best friend filled with goodies that would help make her birthday a little better. Fish asked me if we could collab on a new peace of art as the statement piece of the of care package. I happily agreed to, as I wanted to help and I have not gotten the chance to do any creative work lately. I sketched the calla lillies and Fish water-colored them. We both ended up loving how it looked, so please enjoy these pictures showing the process of drawing and painting the calla lilies!
