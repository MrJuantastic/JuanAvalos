*Fish looks at me with a huge smile on her face. I can tell that her heart just melted at the cuteness she is witnessing infront of her.*

Fish: Okay, now I want one.

Me: What happened to waiting until we were ready?

Fish: I know, but look at how cute he is!

*I look down to see the little one running around. I can’t help but smile myself.*

Me: Yeah, he’s pretty cute.

Fish: See, you want one too!

Me: I mean I do eventually, but the timing still isn’t right babe.

Fish: I know…

*Fish’s smile fades a little bit.*

Me: Maybe when we move into a bigger place we can talk about it again.

Fish: Yeah, like when we buy a house! We’ll have plenty of space for little ones to run around!

Me: That would be nice.

Fish: I just want both of us to be in a comfortable place before we make such a big life change.

Me: I know, we’re almost there babe. I promise

*I hug Fish. She squeezes me a bit harder than usual.*

Fish: I can’t wait! Do you want to pick him up?

Me: I’m okay, I think you want to pick him up way more than I do.

Fish: Yiiiiiiis.

*Fish kneels down and picks up my brother’s new dog, Blue.*
