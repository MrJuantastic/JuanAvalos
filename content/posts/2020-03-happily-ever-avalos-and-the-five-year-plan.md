> *Fish looks at me with a huge smile on her face. I can tell that her heart just melted at the cuteness she is witnessing in front of her.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Okay, now I want one.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: What happened to waiting until we were ready?

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I know, but look at how cute he is!

*I look down to see the little one running around. I can’t help but smile myself.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Yeah, he’s pretty cute.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: See, you want one too!

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I mean I do eventually, but the timing still isn’t right babe.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I know…

*Fish’s smile fades a little bit.*

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: Maybe when we move into a bigger place we can talk about it again.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Yeah, like when we buy a house! We’ll have plenty of space for little ones to run around!

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: That would be nice.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I just want both of us to be in a comfortable place before we make such a big life change.

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I know, we’re almost there babe. I promise

*I hug Fish. She squeezes me a bit harder than usual.*

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: I can’t wait! Do you want to pick him up?

<span style="color:darkorange">Me</span>: I’m okay, I think you want to pick him up way more than I do.

<span style="color:darkblue">Fish</span>: Yiiiiiiis!

*Fish kneels down and picks up my brother’s new dog, Blue.*

> Meet my new Great Dane nephew, Blue! 

I bet all of you thought Fish and I were talking about having a baby. **A BABY?! IN THIS ECONOMY? IN THIS ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE? CAN YOU IMAGINE?!** Well I know you can, because Fish and I do. We talk about when we would like to start a family. It is a chapter of our lives that we are both very excited to experience. When we got engaged in 2016 and were both 21, we talked about starting to have kids when we were 27. That seemed like enough time to be settled somewhere nice with our very own house, have stable jobs that we both loved, and be mentally ready to begin that new chapter. That was our five-year plan. Well five years have passed from when we got engaged, Fish and I are both about to turn 26 this summer, and we are nowhere near ready to have a baby. If you’ve read previous Happily Ever Avalos Volumes, you know that Fish and I have gone through a major life transition and the last 8 months have been a whirlwind of emotions. If you haven’t, I HIGHLY recommend you take some time to check out the previous 4 installments. In the meantime, the TLDR is that Fish changed careers to be a nurse, I quit my very comfortable engineering job, and we moved back to Texas from across the country for Fish’s new nursing job and for me to pursue grad school.

As Fish and I continue to talk about the future, we have again said and planned to start trying to have a family in five years from now. In the meantime, we want to focus on ourselves and each other first. Professionally, we are working to get more clarity and stability about our careers. Fish is working night shifts, but would like to transition to day shifts to provide a little bit more stability to her natural circadian rhythm. I am expecting grad school admission notices by mid-March and it would help to provide clarity about what the next two years could possibly look like. Personally, we want to get back into a healthy routine, further explore our hobbies, and grow as individuals and as a couple. Therefore, Fish and I are utilizing three different forms of birth control to ensure that for the moment we can continue focusing on ourselves and get to a more comfortable place before we are responsible for caring for another human being. Now don’t get us wrong, if even with everything we are doing we somehow manage to get pregnant, we will be extremely happy and excited to have a kid! First of all, that kid went against three forms of birth control and won. That’s hella impressive. Second of all, we are now surrounded by an amazing support system between our family and friends which help us in raising a child. Lastly, Fish and I are more than willing and able to make the necessary adjustments to still pursue our goals and passions while raising a kid. It might be a little more difficult than it was before, but not impossible. 

Now let me explain why this article is focused on this specific topic. When Fish and I were walking Rocka and talking about this subject, Fish noticed that I get a little more worked up than she does about people asking us when we are planning on having kids. Now, let me be clear on what I’m about to say. I don’t personally mind when someone I just met or someone who I do know but has never asked us about kids asks us about when we are having kids. I understand that these individuals might be excited for Fish and I to have kids. Therefore, I am more than happy to explain our circumstances and the plan we have for having kids. What seems to bother me is the group of people that STILL keep badgering away about when are having kids even after we explained to them multiple times why we are not choosing to have kids yet. These are the type of comments that seems to get on my nerves. It is just this cultural and societal norm that we have to have kids as soon as possible that rubs me the wrong way. When people keep asking us about kids, it makes me feel that they are no longer interested in our dreams, goals, and passions and that they don’t see value in us unless we have a child. I know that is not true at all and not what people intend to do, but that is how they make me feel. So unless we bring up the topic of having kids, please don’t keep asking us when we are going to have a baby. When and if we decide to have kids, I promise y’all that Fish and I will let y’all know about it and we’ll celebrate accordingly.

> Being the cool aunt and uncle is the closest form of parenting we have in mind

The other reason why it bothers me so much when people just keep asking others when they are going to have kids is that it could be extremely hurtful and triggering for some people. They fail to keep in mind any struggles others have or are experiencing. A woman could have had a miscarriage in her past. A couple could have infertility issues. A man could have lost his wife and/or child during childbirth in the past. There might be physical or mental health issues involved. It might not be the right time for someone to have kids and for some people they straight up just do not want to have any kids at all. Whatever the intention you have when asking the people about kids, it can cause severe sadness, pain, stress and/or grief. For those of you reading this and thinking I am either exaggerating or being too sensitive, it happens way more often than you think. There are many other questions you can ask other people. Ask them about what the best part of their day. Ask them about what they are passionate about. Ask them what goals they have set for themselves in the future. If at any point someone shares with you if they have kids or when they plan on having kids, let that by their choice.

I want to end this post to say that even with everything I just said, I am incredibly excited about being a dad one day. Whether Fish and I have our own baby, or through adoption, or any other form of having a child, I cannot wait for Fish and I to raise a little hooman together. I am sure we are totally going to be those “cool” parents who embarrass our kid(s) in front of their friends with our dad jokes and silly behavior. Nonetheless, we will love our kid(s) for who they are, will nurture their passions, provide for their needs, understand their emotions, and support their hopes and dreams. Until then, Fish and I will continue to stick to our plan and when we are ready, we’ll get a new puppy of our own so Rocka can have someone to play with.
