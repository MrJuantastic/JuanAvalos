Often times when I feel stressed or frustrated, I turn to poetry to express what I am feeling. The thought of this poem came to me nearly a year ago as I was in the process of leaving my full-time job. I finally decided to sit down and write this poem last summer when I decided to pursue graduate school. At first this poem meant to serve as my personal statement of purpose. However, I had to scrap the idea since this poem did not address some critical questions that a good statement of purpose is meant to answer. I decided to keep the poem because something inside of me told me that I would use it later. I am a week from my graduate school admission decisions and this poem is serving as my beacon of hope. If you are going through something similar, I see you and I am incredibly proud of you for betting on yourself.

I grew up at a very fast pace.\
Every other year it was a new school in a new place.\
Growing up like this made it hard to feel like I had somewhere I belonged.\
I had no other choice but to keep moving along and try to stay strong.\
I had to find new ways to express all my pent-up emotions.\
It didn’t take long to figure out that art helped to settle my internal commotions.\
It all started very simple.\
Little doodles on the corners of my notebook served as the kindle.\
Doodles turned to portraits. Portraits inspired poems. Poems sparked short stories.\
All these outlets opened a portal to a kingdom full of riches and glories.\
Right as my inspiration began to catch fire, it abruptly became extinguished.\
Society told me a “real career” path was needed, and my creative interests had to be relinquished.

I got a “Big Boy Job” but deep down I knew it was personal fulfillment that I never came near.\
I didn’t understand why I felt inadequate and how this lead to become a fear.\
Society made me feel ashamed and like a failure for everything I had not yet accomplished.\
The only thing this did was make anxiety my main accomplice.\
I felt hexed.\
I quickly grew depressed and began living in distress.\
Not even to my wife could I confess the stress I now possessed and how it hindered my success.\
I digress, but I knew I had to act fast before I lived a life full of regrets.

I went back home one summer to try and clear my mind.\
I ended up going through my old room to see what forgotten items I would find.\
I sifted through Lego sets, Pokémon cards, and a set of hot wheels beginning to get some rust.\
I came across a lonely box at the top of my closet collecting dust.\
I picked up the box and set it down on the floor. \
What I found inside the box shook me to my core.\
An old tattered red notebook is what I found inside.\
I stared at it in disbelief and I cried.\
It was the same notebook that served as a creative catalyst for me when I was younger.\
This rediscovery made me realize that I couldn’t keep lying to myself any longer.\
It was time to be bold and spring into action.\
It is time for me to finally pursue my creative passion.

A phoenix arises from its ashes to a new beginning.\
I feel rejuvenated as I embark into a life with new meaning.\
It’s time to slow things down and figure out a plan.\
From now on I will try my best to stay true to who I really am.\
I may not have everything figured out like those around me.\
I don’t worry about that because I’m on my way to become exactly who I was always meant to be.
